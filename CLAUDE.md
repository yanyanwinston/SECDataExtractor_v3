# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SECDataExtractor_v3 is a tool for extracting and processing SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) data. This is currently a minimal repository that needs to be built from scratch.

## Current State

This repository is in its initial state with only a basic README.md file. The codebase needs to be developed based on the project requirements for SEC data extraction.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, the tech stack and development environment will need to be established based on the specific requirements for SEC data extraction tools.

## Notes for Development

- The project name suggests this is version 3 of an SEC data extractor, implying there may be lessons learned from previous versions
- SEC data typically involves working with EDGAR database, XBRL files, and financial filings
- Consider using Python for data processing tasks given the financial data nature of the project
